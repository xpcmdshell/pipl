# Pipl (unofficial)
This repository holds an unofficial package that can be used to interface with the Pipl search API in Golang. Some [example code](https://godoc.org/github.com/xpcmdshell/pipl#example-package) to get you started (and develop and intuition for how the package is used) can be seen on the accompanying GoDoc page.  Pull requests and bug reports are welcome.

## Where can I use this package?
This package is released under the MIT license. It comes without warranty, and I am not held liable. So long as you include the license and accompanying copyright notice, it can be used essentially anywhere.

## Docs?
[Here you go.](https://godoc.org/github.com/xpcmdshell/pipl)

I will add more examples and tests to the GoDoc page over time.

## And how to get it?
```go get github.com/xpcmdshell/pipl```
